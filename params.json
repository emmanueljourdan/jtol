  "name": "Jtol",
  "tagline": "Jtol is built and used by jt rinker and olivier pasquet. It is a library dedicated to real-time pattern generation and can be applied to architectural design, music, dance; everything requiring constructed evolution in space and time. It deals with multi-scaling and multi-dimensions where rhythm is considered to be a skeleton onto everything else is attached (pitches, params…). Jtol was first programmed in python in max with the help of bertrand nouvel. It gathered data structures similar to the jitter library but with a nested architecture. A newer version is now using the bach library and still runs in max. It has nevertheless been programmed in order to always be able to easily get rid of the bach library. It is inspired by libraries like athenaCL, numpy, scipy, abjad, pyevolve, pwgl and open music. Some purely generative music devices will soon come for max for live.",
  "body": "### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
